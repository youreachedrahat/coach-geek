  Coach Geek - LMS Platform.
</h1>

<p><font size="3">
  Coach Geek is a LMS platform built using <strong><em>HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Express, JWT and many more</em></strong>. it still doesn't have all the features of LMS platform. it's a similar version of LMS with my own design touch, showing my abilities in Javascript and CSS to build something advanced like LMS. It contains the home page, sign-in page, sign-up page, landing page, Course page, 404 page, etc.
